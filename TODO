 V remove mongodb-memory-server
  - README.md
  - handle missing persons items, comparing date of last update and date of last scrape (use a virtual method)
  - protect system from multiple scrape requests (I think it's a good thing...)
  - in providers do avoid `document.querySelectorAll(...).something...`, but do `const el = document.querySelectorAll(...); if (el) { el.something... }`
  - review mongodb network access list (https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/5ffc6bd7ff8754133fc84727#security/network/accessList)
  - auth endpointRoles better to be in database ?
  - test:
    V login with password unselectable in model
    - what happens if an item has no main image in getItems (should be returned nonetheless)
    - stars in PF providerScraping (temporarily enable only PF provider, and set it as not immutable)
    - filterFresh in getItems
    - filterMissing (check on holiday items, missing items, and immutable items) in getItems
    - extraction of comments votes from getItems query
    - groupItems()
